      Servings: 30 (slices pepperoni)
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Ingredients</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>10 ounces extra-firm tofu (organic when possible)</li>
        <li>1 - 1 1/2 tsp each sea salt and ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2-3 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (depending on preferred heat level)</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1 tsp fennel seeds (lightly crushed)</li>
        <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp coconut sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground anise</li>
        <li>1 tsp A1 sauce or liquid smoke (optional)</li>
        <li>Cooking spray or olive oil for baking</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Instructions</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Wrap tofu in a clean towel and set something heavy on top - like a cast-iron skillet - to press out liquid for 10-15 minutes. Also preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).</li>
        <li>Once pressed, cube tofu and add to a food processor along with sea salt, black pepper, red pepper flake, ground mustard, fennel seeds, smoked paprika, garlic powder, coconut sugar, ground anise, and A1 sauce/liquid smoke (optional). Mix/pulse to combine, scraping down sides as needed.</li>
        <li>Sample and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt for saltiness, red pepper flake for heat, paprika for smokiness, or coconut sugar for sweetness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to a parchment-lined baking sheet (or more baking sheets, as needed, if increasing batch size). Lay a sheet of plastic wrap or parchment paper on top and use your hands to spread into a uniformly thin layer about 1/4th - 1/8th inch thick (see photo). The more even the layer is, the more evenly it will bake. Spritz with a little nonstick spray or gently brush with a bit of oil to help it crisp up.</li>
        <li>Bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes, or until golden brown and slightly dried out. Then use a small or medium circular cookie cutter to cut out “pepperonis” (see photo). Feel free to keep the scrap pieces as well! They're just not as pretty.</li>
        <li>At this point, the pepperonis are ready to add to a pizza, where they should bake at least another 10-15 minutes. Time accordingly based on how long your crust takes to bake. You'll know they're ready when they're deep red in color and slightly crisp to the touch.</li>
        <li>If you don't want to add them to a pizza right away, simply let them cool, cover, and refrigerate (up to 4 days) or freeze (up to 1 month) for later use. If frozen, let thaw slightly before adding to the pizza to bake.</li>
     </ol>
